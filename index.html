  <p>The South Korean government said Thursday that Japan has allowed high-tech materials to be exported
    to South Korea in the first approval since the Shinzo Abe administration imposed export curbs in July
    on three materials crucial for Korea’s chip and display production.

  Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon said Thursday that Japan had granted its first approval
    for exporting extreme ultraviolet photoresists to Korea a day earlier. EUV photoresists are one of the three materials
    that Japan restricted for export from July 4. It is a key material for Samsung’s chipmaking foundry business.

  “The government will continue to beef up its diplomatic efforts
    to restore from Japan’s economic attack,” he said during a related ministers’ meeting
    that had gathered to discuss the details of Japan’s new export regulations to take effect from Aug. 28.

  But Japan did not specifically designate additional materials
    for export restriction, other than three items it announced on July 1, Lee added.

  Domestic industries viewed that Japan’s approval of the high-tech material export
    to South Korea in 34 days was intended to avoid criticisms from the international community, which have been mounting toward Japan
    after it introduced a new four-group classification system for its entrusted trade partners on Wednesday.

  Based on the new classification announced by Japan’s Trade Ministry,
    Korea will be put to Group B from Aug. 28, which comprises countries that come under certain export control regimes
    that Tokyo must approve. For Group B countries, it can take up to 90 days for Japanese authorities to review export approval,
    whereas Group A countries enjoy trade benefits such as fast-track export clearance.

  Meanwhile, President Moon Jae-in once again denounced Japan’s export restrictions, calling for a diplomatic resolution.
